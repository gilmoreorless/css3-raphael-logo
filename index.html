	<h1>CSS3 Rapha&euml;l Logo</h1>
	<p>
		Why? Because I was bored and wanted to do something tricky with CSS3 &ndash; and re-rendering the
		logo of a javascript vector graphics library without using javascript or SVG seemed like a
		wonderfully pointless way to spend a Sunday evening.
	</p>
	<p>
		Firefox and Safari are the best browsers to view this in &ndash;
		Chrome <em>used</em> to work fine until one of its many updates changed its border rendering style.
		Now Chrome seems to stretch and thin out borders with multiple radii defined.
	</p>
	<p>The main things I learned about CSS3 from this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			WebKit doesn't handle border radius on a rotated element properly &ndash;
			there are sometimes distinctive gaps betweeen the curves and straight borders.
		</li>
		<li>
			-webkit-background-clip should be set to "padding-box" to prevent an element's background
			colour from bleeding out just past its border.
		</li>
		<li>
			Firefox's and Chrome's rendering of partial borders with radius measurements tapers the borders to a point
			while Safari keeps a continuous border width. Chrome used to work in same way as Safari
			but seems to have switched to Firefox's rendering style (with some extra stretching thrown in).
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Also, I know the right-hand corner isn't <em>quite</em> right, but it's close enough for me.</p>
